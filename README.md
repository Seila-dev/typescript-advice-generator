# ⭐ Advice Generator App - TypeScript + React

## 📜 Project Description
This is a Single Page Application that allows users to search for random advice via the API. With each click on the button, a different piece of advice is rendered. See which one will surprise you the most!

## 👨‍💻 Application functions
- Click button to change the advice phrase to a new one

## 🛠️ Tools used
- TypeScript: Increase code typing and reduce the number of possible errors
- ReactJS: Create components and manage app state
- Hooks - State management
- Axios: HTTP requests

## 🌪️ Project difficulties
- TypeScript in general: Even though I've just finished a study session on typeScript, I confess that it's complicated to understand all the functionalities of elements such as “interface” and asynchronous function typing. But it's nothing that can't be learned. I'm happy to have managed to understand most of these concepts in this simple project.

## 💭 Possible future updates
- Finish the readMe correctly ✅
- Add button to change background color with Context API
